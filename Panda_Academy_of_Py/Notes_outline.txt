Import pandas
bring in both csv files

print a few lines of data headers of both files

Manipulate the data and organize

Need to merge data:
Add to Student data: School Type--> type in school_data
Question: Do i need to move size and budget to student level 
       ---Size would be helpful when doing averages of the school, but not by Grade
       --Other side, there is little to no value
       
Run analysis on data set (.describe)


Look for issues with the data (un-even records, null values, etc.)


total_schools =school_data ["School Id"].count()
total_students=student_data ["Student Id].count()
total_budget =school_data["budget"].sum()

Avg_math_score = 
                        Avg_reading_score=````````````
